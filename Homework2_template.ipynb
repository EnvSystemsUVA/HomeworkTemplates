Each day, he measured the concentration of chlorella (a type of algae) and counted the number of rotifers (type of plankton that eats chlorella) in the chemostat. He modeled the chlorella and rotifer populations by the Fussman model of predator-prey dynamics (Fussman et al., 2000), represented by the following system of differential equations:\n","\\begin{align}\n","    \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\delta (N_0 - N) - \\frac{B_C N}{K_C + N} C\\\\\n","    \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{B_C N}{K_C + N} C - \\frac{B_R C}{K_R + C} \\Big(\\frac{R}{e}\\Big) - \\delta C\\\\\n","    \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{B_R C}{K_R + C}R - (\\delta + m)R\n","\\end{align}\n","### where $C$, $R$, and $N$ are the quantities of chlorella, rotifers and nitrogen; $K_C$ and $K_R$ are the half-saturation constants of chlorella and rotifers; $B_C$ and $B_R$ are the growth rate of chlorella and rotifers; $e$ is the assimilation efficiency of the predator; $m$ is the mortality rate of the predator; and $\\delta$ is the flow rate in the chemostat. He hypothesized that the half-saturation constant of the rotifers in this system, $K_R$, would be affected by salinity. Let's test his hypothesis! Attached is the data he collected, after being smoothed by exponential smoothing.\n","\n","### a. Write a function called Fussmann that simulates the set of three differential equations in equations 1-3 in continuous time. The function should take 3 arguments: a length 6 vector of parameters, a length 4 vector of independent variables ($N_0$, $C_0$, $R_0$ and $\\delta$), and a length $n$ vector of time steps. The function should return two vectors of length $n$ with simulated C and R values. Simulate n=38 time steps of this model assuming the parameters and initial values provided in Table 1.

Report the average NSE and parameter estimates of each fit. Note that the Algae columns correspond to Chlorella populations.
