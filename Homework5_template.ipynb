A reservoir serves multiple purposes. It is a recreation site for swimmers, wind surfers and boaters; a flood storage reservoir; and an irrigation supply structure. Each season, there is a required minimum release for irrigation to meet water rights downstream. Reservoir releases in excess of the irrigation requirement flow to a wetland downstream. The wetland also receives return flows from irrigation, equal to 30\\% of the water diverted for irrigation. These return flows are highly saline, which can damage the ecosystem. Different target water allocations are favorable for each of these objectives. Based on mean inflows across 4 seasons, your task is to determine how much water should be released from the reservoir in each season to minimize the sum of percent deviation across all targets given the following parameters and targets:\n","\n","* Reservoir storage capacity, $K$: 30 million m$^3$ (mcm)\n","* Maximum reservoir release, $Rmax$: 50 mcm\n","* Reservoir average seasonal inflows, $Qin$: 10, 40, 30, 20 mcm\n","* Minimum releases for irrigation each season, $Qirr$: 5, 20, 10, 5 mcm\n","* Salinity concentration of reservoir water, $Cres$: 1 part per trillion (ppt)\n","* Salinity concentration of irrigation return flow water, $Cirr$: 20 ppt\n","* Target salinity concentration in the wetland, $Cwet\\_maxTarget$: 5 ppt\n","* Target minimum flow in the wetland each season, $Qwet\\_minTarget$: 10, 20, 15, 15 mcm\n","* Target reservoir storages each period, $S$: 20, 5, 20, 20 mcm"],"metadata":{"id":"qCBpkztdnCsO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part a\n","\n","Draw a mass flow diagram of the water and salt movement into and through the system in a given season $t$.
