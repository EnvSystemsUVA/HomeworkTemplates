Radar Rainfall Problem\n","\n","Radar can be used to estimate rainfall rates based on the reflectivity of raindrops. The relationship between radar reflectivity $Z$ (mm$^6$/m$^3$) and rainfall rate $R$ (mm/hr) follows a power law: $Z = aR^b$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Radar reflectivity is a function of the raindrop size distribution: $Z = E[ND^6]$ where $N$ is the number of raindrops per unit volume (mm$^{-1}$m$^3$) and $D$ is a random variable representing the raindrop diameter (mm). It is often assumed that the diameters of raindrops follow an exponential distribution: $f_D(d) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda d}$, which has a domain of (0,$\\infty$).\n","\n","a. Knowing $Z = E[ND^6]$ and $f_D(d) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda d}$, calculate Z as a function of $N$ and $\\lambda$. Hint: use the definition of the gamma function $\\Gamma(\\alpha) = \\int_0^\\infty  x^{\\alpha-1} e^{-x} dx = (\\alpha-1)!$ and let $x=\\lambda d$.\n","\n","b. Marshall and Palmer (1948) found that the raindrop density $N$ is approximately constant at 8000 mm$^{-1}$ m$^{-3}$ regardless of the rainfall rate. However, the parameter $\\lambda$ of the raindrop size distribution varies across events. Assume $\\lambda$ also follows an exponential distribution, but with a lower bound of 1 and parameter $\\beta=0.5$: $f(\\lambda) = \\beta e^{-\\beta (\\lambda-1)}$.
